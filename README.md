# Streamlit App: Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

This project is a Movie Review Sentiment Classifier created using a Streamlit app and a machine learning pipeline. It analyzes IMDB movie reviews to predict whether the user's review is **positive** or **negative**. The model was trained using a Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF vectorization on a labeled dataset of movie reviews. Users can input a movie review into the app, and it will display the predicted sentiment along with the model's confidence level.
