# Streamlit_App

Description: This is a Movie Review Sentiment Classifier created through the Streamlit app/package and uses a machine learning pipeline to analyze whether IMDB movie reviews are positive or negative. The model was trained using a Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization on a labeled dataset of movie reviews. Users can input a movie review into the app, and it will display the predicted sentiment along with the model's confidence level. 

To run, just download all files, open your terminal in the project directory and run the following: streamlit run app.py
